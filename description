# Azure Honeypot Lab

This repository demonstrates a **cybersecurity honeypot lab** deployed using **Azure Container Instances**.  
The lab captures logs from simulated attack traffic and provides evidence for monitoring and analysis.

---

## 🛠 Lab Overview

**Objective:**  
Deploy a publicly accessible honeypot container to capture logs for cybersecurity monitoring.  

**Components Used:**  
- Azure Resource Group (`RG-Honeypot`)  
- Azure Container Instance (`honeypot-web`)  
- Public IP for external access  
- Log Analytics Workspace (optional for extended logging)  

**Container Image:**  
`mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld` — prints messages to stdout, which appear in Azure Container logs.

## 📂 Evidence

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `02-container-instance-running.png` | Container overview and state |
| `03-honeypot-webpage.png` | Public IP webpage (simulated honeypot) |
| `04-logs.png` | Logs showing container stdout activity |
| `05-log-export.csv` | CSV export of container logs |

> Optional: Include `IncidentReport.pdf` in `threat-report/` folder summarizing suspicious traffic.

## 📝 How Traffic Was Generated

- Browsed the Public IP multiple times  
- Simulated attacks with paths like `/admin` and `/login`  
- Traffic appears in the container logs in the Azure portal

## ⚡ Learning Outcomes

1. Deployed Azure Container Instance as a honeypot  
2. Generated and captured container logs  
3. Collected evidence suitable for SOC2 / ISO27001 style reporting  
4. Gained hands-on experience with container logging and monitoring in Azure

## 🔗 Next Steps / Extensions

- Forward container logs to **Log Analytics Workspace** for advanced queries  
- Add multiple honeypot containers simulating different services  
- Create dashboards to visualize traffic patterns and attacker behavior  
- Automate alerts for suspicious access attempts
